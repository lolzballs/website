I'm Benjamin Cheng (aka `bcheng` or `lolzballs`). I try to share things I hope
people will find interesting/useful at my [blog](@/blog/_index.md).

Currently I'm in my 3rd year doing Engineering Science student specializing
in Machine Intelligence at the University of Toronto. I will be doing my PEY
(one-year internship) at AMD Markham in 2021-2022, working on Multimedia Drivers.

I have an interest in making things run fast, whether its low-level things like
networking and hardware, or high-level things like machine learning algorithms,
and websites.
