title = "Site Redesign"
+++

Wow... it's been a long time since I considered updating my website.

Ever since I started using sway, I started following the sourcehut guys'
([Drew Devault](https://drewdevault.com) and [Simon Ser](https://emersion.fr))
blogs. They have really influenced my philosophy, so I decided to redesign my
website using a static site generator ([Zola](https://getzola.org)). The keener
eyed will notice a few stylistic similarities in the site (i.e. the layout of
the home page). No more node backend, no more authentication, no more dependencies
going out of date -- just plain HTML generated from Markdown.

In addition I've tried to minimize the number of styles I'm using while keeping
things aesthetically pleasing to make things as *fff*ast as possible. I quite
like how things turned out!

I hope to continue writing, maybe once or twice a month is a reasonable target
for me.
