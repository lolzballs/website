I have two (slightly varying) devices which I do my computing on. I share my
dotfiles on [GitHub](https://github.com/lolzballs/dotfiles).

# Common
- Operating System: Arch Linux
- Text Editor: `neovim` and `nvim-qt`
- Web Browser: `firefox`
- Email Client: `aerc`
- Terminal Emulator: `termite`
- Shell: `fish`

I use `org-mode` and `evil-mode` in `emacs` for task management. I also recently
started using `pipewire` to replace `pulseaudio` and it seems to be working
pretty well!
